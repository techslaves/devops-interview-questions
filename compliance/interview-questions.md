<summary>What is Contingency Planning (CP) ?</summary>
  
Contingency Planning (CP) is the process of preparing for unexpected disruptions to systems, services, or operations‚Äîespecially critical in highly regulated environments like FedRAMP.
In the context of FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program), CP is a mandatory security control family based on NIST SP 800-53. It helps ensure:

- Your cloud systems can recover from interruptions
- Essential functions continue with minimal downtime
- You document, test, and train for emergency situations
- You're compliant with CP controls like:
  CP-2: Contingency Plan
  CP-4: Contingency Plan Testing
  CP-6: Alternate Storage Site
  CP-9: Information System Backup

<summary>What is SSP document in FedRAMP compliance? </summary>
  
A FedRAMP SSP is a comprehensive record detailing the security controls for a cloud system, demonstrating how each control is implemented, maintained, and monitored

Purpose:

It serves as the foundational document for authorization.
3PAOs (Third‚ÄëParty Assessment Organizations), FedRAMP reviewers, and federal agencies rely on the SSP to assess whether a CSP's cloud offering meets FedRAMP requirements
It facilitates ‚Äúdo once, use many times‚Äù ‚Äì enabling multiple agencies to leverage the same validated document

A typical FedRAMP SSP (aligned to a specific impact level: Low, Moderate, or High) contains:
System overview ‚Äì including diagrams, boundaries, network flows, user roles, and service/deployment models 
Security Control Implementation ‚Äì Describes NIST SP 800-53-based controls; whether each is implemented, inherited, planned, or partially implemented.
Roles & Responsibilities ‚Äì Who manages each control and the division of responsibility between CSP, federal agency, or shared
Supporting Attachments ‚Äì such as contingency plans, rules of behavior, configuration management, etc. often included as SSP appendices 

SSP is mandatory for any CSP seeking FedRAMP authorization‚Äîwhether through an Agency ATO or a JAB P-ATO
It uses FedRAMP‚Äëprovided templates (for the appropriate impact baseline) and follows NIST 800‚Äë53 guidelines
