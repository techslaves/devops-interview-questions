<summary>What is Contingency Planning (CP) ?</summary>
  
Contingency Planning (CP) is the process of preparing for unexpected disruptions to systems, services, or operationsâ€”especially critical in highly regulated environments like FedRAMP.
In the context of FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program), CP is a mandatory security control family based on NIST SP 800-53. It helps ensure:

- Your cloud systems can recover from interruptions
