<details>
<summary>You allowed inbound traffic on port 80 using a NACL, but your application isnâ€™t responding. Why might that be ?</summary>
NACLs are stateless. You must also allow the outbound traffic on ephemeral ports for the response to be sent back.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You associated a custom NACL with a private subnet and now can't SSH into your instance. What's the issue?</summary>
Possibly:

NACL is blocking SSH (port 22) on inbound or outbound.
NACL lacks rules to allow return traffic due to statelessness.

<summary>Can two different subnets with different NACLs communicate if their routes allow it?</summary>
